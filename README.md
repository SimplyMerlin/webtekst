# WebTekst

## What is WebTekst?
WebTekst is a dutch news site which aims to be as bare bones as realistically possible. An incredible way to skip out on the chaos and clickbait happening in the online news space.

## When will it be running?
As of now this project is on **hold**. Without any article writers, creating a reliable news source is a tough task! Perhaps in the near future some writers could be hired. Alternatively a RSS feed could be used?

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.
